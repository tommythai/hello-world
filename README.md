github hello-world tutorial
I am learning how to use Github which I should have already known from my boot camp but information and deadlines were coming so fast I was not able to learn it and use it and just skipped it. I have a baby boy name Alvin and he's about 6.5 months old and he's a handful. He's my first child.
